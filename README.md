# Movie_Recommender - speeded up algorithm
Capstone 1 project to recommend movies 

NOTE:
This repository contains some files that contain data from API that will be used in the database. Database contains 20,000+ movies. Recommender uses POS tagging and word embeddings of the  tags to generate cosine similarities that will give us most similar movies. (Please refer to code for specific algorithm).
